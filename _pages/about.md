Hello dear reader :wave:

Welcome to my home on the Internet.<br>
My name is Alex Castaño and this is my personal blog.

### About me

I'm a Spanish guy who writes better code than English,
so please, excuse me for any mistakes
you can find in this blog
--- or better, let me a comment so I'll fix it.

I'm 28 years old and I live in Barcelona.
I love to joke, good _tapas_ and the _siesta_,
probably because I was born in the lovely city of [Sevilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville){:rel="nofollow"}.

I'm passionate about programming,
and more specifically about creating helpful software for people in all its dimensions:
design, user experience, coding, business, marketing...
I'm also a tireless learner and a kind of bootstrapper.

In addition to computers,
I also enjoy football, economics, skating, kite surf, sports, reading, watching series, traveling, music...
You know, typical stuff!


### About the blog

My motivation for this micro space in the WWW
is to return a little of the knowledge I acquired from the Internet,
especially from the Free/Open Software community.

This is a mostly technical blog
with posts about
programming, Linux, deployments, servers, vim, web, etc.
I like sharing what I've learned in the day,
giving sometimes,
a strong opinion about it
--- but I reserve my right to change my mind at any time :smile:

I also publish about the side projects I'm working on,
personal experiences and business stuff.
Hopefully, it will be useful for people creating their own projects as well.

### Current work

Right now, my main goal is to create a profitable business by myself.
The last one is [Deverify](https://deverify.com),
a tool to test developers before hiring them.

At the same time,
I work as an independent consultant for complex problems in Ruby,
including application design, performance issues, architecture, etc.
I also do small or medium projects for clients when
full dedication is not a requirement.

If you think I'd be the ideal person for your project,
please **send me an email** to: alexcastanodev (at) gmail (dot) com

### Background

I started coding at the age of 14.
I spent my free time in High School
learning C & C++,
creating amateur games,
learning the command line
and compiling kernels.

I studied Computer Engineering at [Seville University](https://www.informatica.us.es/){:rel="nofollow"},
where I also worked
on its own open source solution to remotely restore OS in the University's computers.

Very soon I created my own company.
I built projects for clients and they usually paid me.
But after years of doing consulting
and a failed own project,
I closed my 9 people company.
We hadn't interesting projects,
the money was very unstable,
and the stress was constant.
So I realized I needed a change.

I moved to Ireland to learn some English.
I worked for a year at the lovely [OnePageCRM](https://onepagecrm.com){:rel="nofollow"} startup.
There I learned a lot of things
--- the most of them not technical ---
to success with your own project.

Later I went to Barcelona with better food and much better weather.
I worked at FCM France & Switzerland,
a big company but with a small and friendly development team.

When I felt I was ready, I quit starting my own business again.
Now I'm trying to get [Deverify](https://deverify.com) working
and doing some consulting to pay the bills.
