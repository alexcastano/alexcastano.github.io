:wave: Hello dear reader,

Welcome to my home on the Internet.<br>
My name is Alex Casta√±o and this is my personal blog.

### About me

I'm not a father and
I'm not a husband either,
but it seems the first thing the blogger must say,
so do I.
I'm just Spanish guy who writes much better Ruby than English,
so please, excuse me for the writing mistakes.

I love to joke, the good _tapas_ and the _siestas_,
maybe because I was born in the lovely city of [Sevilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville){:rel="nofollow"}.
I'm currently living in Barcelona and I'm 28 years old.

I'm passionate about programming,
but especially creating helpful software for people in all its dimensions:
design, user experience, coding, business, marketing...
I'm also a tireless learner and a kind of bootstrapper.

In addition to computer stuff
I also enjoy skating, sports, reading, watching series, traveling, music...
You know the typical stuff.
Finally, I like football (soccer) and I support Sevilla F.C. team.


### About the blog

The motivation for this micro space in the WWW
is returning a little of the knowledge I acquired from the Internet,
especially from the Free/Open Software community.
Everything I know about software is thanks
to the people who take the time to share their wisdom on the web.
To all of you, thank you so much :heart:

This is a mostly technical blog
with post about
programming, Linux, deployments, servers, vim, web, etc.
As well,
I publish about the side projects I'm working on,
personal experiences and business stuff.
Hopefully, it is useful for people which are creating their own projects as well.

### Current work

Right now, my main goal is to create profitable projects by myself
and with the help of some colleagues.
The last one is [Deverify](https://deverify.com),
a tool to test developer before hiring them,
with my friend [Baptiste](https://twitter.com/jacquemetb){:rel="nofollow"}.

At the same time,
I work as an independent consultant for complex problems in Ruby,
including application design, performance issues, architecture, etc.
I also do small or medium projects for clients where
fast delivering and full dedication are not the maximum priority.

If your circumstances fit my needs,
and if you think I'd be the ideal person for your project,
just send me an email to alexcastanodev@gmail.com

### Background

I started coding with 14 years old.
I downloaded a manual of C,
later another of C++ and I created my own amateur games.
I realized that programming was my passion.

At the same time,
I installed a Debian on my computer
and I discovered the Open Source and Linux World.
I remember compiling the kernel bazillion times
until I got my pre-802.11b wireless card finally working.

I studied Computer Engineering at [Seville University](https://www.informatica.us.es/){:rel="nofollow"}
and where I was working for many years on [OpenGnSys](http://www.opengnsys.es/){:rel="nofollow"},
a free software to restore and deploy the computer of our installations
and other Spanish Universities.
I was also a member of
[Sugus, the open source association of the University](https://sugus.eii.us.es/acerca_de_sugus){:rel="nofollow"}.
My final project was the implementation of the AODV routing protocol for mesh networks.
It was made in C in the user space but it communicated with the kernel.

In my last year of University,
I created my first company with two partners.
Purely consulting work for clients.
Mainly we did C++/Qt desktop and mobile applications
and web applications using Python & Django and Ruby on Rails.

In my second try,
I wanted to build my own product,
so with the help of my friend Adri,
we started a business
where we worked for clients
and we created a product at the same time.
We hired 7 people and we did dozens of Ruby on Rails applications.
It was really funny and I learned a lot,
but after the product didn't work as we expected
and the consulting were very stressful
with some non-payments works,
we decided to stop it.

It was really hard,
firing people is the most unpleasant thing I have done,
however, I had to be honest with myself.
I realized I didn't want a _"big"_ consulting company,
what I really wanted was to create awesome stuff.

So I realized I had to learn from other successful people.
I moved to Galway (Ireland) and I worked at the lovely [OnePageCRM](https://onepagecrm.com){:rel="nofollow"} startup.
It was a great product made in Ruby on Rails.
There I dealt with scaling problems,
the company was growing and we had more and more clients.
I also worked in the integration of a promising technology called React
to refactor the front end application,
and a new whole payment system using Stripe.

Next, I moved to Barcelona,
with better weather and better food (sometimes :P).
I worked on FCM France & Switzerland,
thanks again to my friend Adri.
It was a big company,
but with a small and very friendly development team.
I enjoyed creating an [Event Sourcing architecture](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html){:rel="nofollow"}
to solve scalability and availability data problems using Ruby.

Until the day I decided that
I learned enough
and I was ready to try creating cool stuff by myself again.
