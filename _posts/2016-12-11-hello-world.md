It's finally here!! This is my new and shiny blog!! Hooray :tada: :tada: :tada:

It has been a long wait... but better late than never.

The main topic of this small space in Internet will be programming and technical stuff.
But I don't consider myself only a developer because what it really
motivates me is to create useful products for people. So I'll also write about
everything around to build a product like marketing, user experience,
make it profitable and many other things that I still don't know but I'll try to learn and to share here.

Furthermore as this is a *personal* blog, I cannot ensure you that eventually
I change the topic and I talk about astronomy or urban gardens, I've always wanted to grow potatoes!

So everything seems ready, let's start!
